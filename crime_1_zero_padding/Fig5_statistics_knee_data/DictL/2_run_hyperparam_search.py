# Add explanations here about gen_commands etc. no need to add code here!


# Instructions - how to calibrate parameters by sending many parallel runs:
# 1. gen_commands.sh - edit this script using linux only, DO NOT EDIT IT IN WINDOWS/PYCHARM! it donesn't compile afterwards.
# 2. make it excutable by running:
# 3. run it: ./gen_commands.sh
#    This will create a scritp named run.sh
# 4. Mkae the print_timestamp script exectuable by running:
#    chmod +x print_timestamp.sh
# 5. TODO: explain here that "gen_commands" will create different run files for each pad_ratio, and they can be sent separately
